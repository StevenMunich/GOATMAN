		<h2>Story of the Day: The Goatman</h2>
	</div>

	<p>Below is the legendary GoatMan. Spotted in Maryland & Pennsylvania. According to stories The Goatman is responsible for all kinds of chaos. From murdering inviduals to being the Anti-Christ himself. No one truly knows who or what it is. According to William Shatner: "There are also tales of them breaking into peoples' houses and raping its victims. And many attest from the areas that he haunts, it does not matter if you're a man or woman." So is The GoatMan real? Or its just a rapist in a costume? "</p>
